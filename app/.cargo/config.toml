# The opt-level is set based on the device model because stack and binary size. While flex and stax has
# 44K of SRAM, Nanos2 and NanoX have 40K. That difference makes necessary an opt-level s for nano x and nano s2,
# because stack size is not enough otherwise.
# In the other hand, stax and flex should use z. They have more stack, but the app won't fit otherwise. The screen libs
# are heavier, and the app with clear signing won't fit.

# Opt-leve z optimize the size more, making the app less performant (consumes more stack)
# Opt-leve s optimize the size, but not that much, making the app a bit more performant (consumes less stack)

# From testing on Nano S2...
# heap 15k, opt-level=z -> 3 participants fail on signing because of heap fragmentation, app size XXX
# heap 16.3k, opt-level=s -> 3 participants work, app size 680K
